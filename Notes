## Low-level IO
- "open()" system call returns the lowest available descriptor
- descriptors:
-- 0 stdin  -> typically connected to keyboard
-- 1 stdout -> tipically connected to the screen (tty)
-- 2 stderr -> same as stdout

- write() / read() -> low level system calls, it just transafers raw binary data between file and memory
- "read()" -> returns the number os bytes actually readed or 0(end-of-file)
- "close()" -> closes the descriptor, makes it available for re-use. Descriptors are implicitly closed when a process terminates
- Always good practice to close the descriptor, because there is a FINITE limit of how many descriptors a process can open
- Sequential access has a File position pointer, witch points to the begining of the file, unless file is open for append
- File position pointer advances on "read()" call
- File position can be explicitly set with "lseek()"

## Standard library IO
- fopen / fwrite / fread / fclose / fseek / rewind
- Uses "FILE *" as descriptor type, while Low level uses "int"
- Uses User-space buffering that can be a performance improvement, while Low level does not
- Is part of C standard
- It does not dive into kernel every time you call it, it accumulates data into a buffer, and only troubles kernel with it when enough data is available for write.

## Scatter/GAther IO
- Read or write multiple buffers of data in a single call
- Its atomic
- Uses mmap to store arrays of data into memory and memcpy to copy data between them

## File Directory and structure
- Files create inodes when created
- Directory is also an inode with links, where links are a relation between name and an inode number
- "stat()" and "fstat()" reads file attributes, basicaly it reads the inode
- Seems odd, but Linux systems do not stores the creation time of a file
- Use "noatime" when mounting a file system, prevents it from update inode timestamps everytime a file is readed

## File Type and Permissions
- "st_mode" field contains important information about the fil

st_mode
│  │  │  │  │ s │ g │ t │ r │ w │ x │ r │ w │ x │ r │ w │ x │
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  File Type                 owner       group       other
                         permissions permissions permissions

r -> read
w -> write
x -> execute
s -> set UID: heart of privileges mechanism
g -> set GID: heart of privileges mechanism
t -> sticky bit: applies to directory, it defines who can delete files from directory. In linux its ignored when applied to ordinary files

- Top four bit of the mode, specifies file type

-- File Type:
- 0010000 -> FIFO (pipe)
- 0020000 -> character device (terminals, ttys)
- 0040000 -> directory
- 0060000 -> block device (disk partitions)
- 0100000 -> regular file
- 0120000 -> symbolic link
- 0140000 -> socket

- "chmod" -> change mode, it chages the "mode" field of the inode

-- Useful Macros
- There are useful symbolic constants and macros representing each byte of st_mode, very nasty names, hard to type, and completely impossible to pronounce

- File Type macros can be directly used as if(S_ISREG(statbuf,st_mode)) prinf("regular file")
- S_ISREG - regular file
- S_ISDIR - directory
- S_ISCHR - character device
- S_ISBLK - block device
- S_ISFIFO
- S_ISLNK - symbolic link
- S_ISSOCK - socket

- Nasty Symbolic constants - bit wise used like if(statbuf.st_mode & S_IWOTH) printf("file is world writeable")
s -> S_ISUID
g -> S_ISGID
t -> S_ISVTX
r -> S_IRUSR
w -> S_IWUSR
x -> S_IXUSR
r -> S_IRGRP
w -> S_IWGRP
x -> S_IXGRP
r -> S_IROTH
w -> S_IWOTH
x -> S_IXOTH

# Creating files (Links)
- open(name, flags, mode) with O_CREAT flag is just linke call creat(name, mode), in the last case, no open, no file descriptor is returned
- link(oldname, newname) - gives the file an additional name, it lies behind "ln" system command
- unlink(name)  removes a link/symlink, it lies behind "rm" system command
-- If it the last link, file is removed, inode is deleted
-- One exception is when file is open. While is a file descriptor open, the file will remain as an annominous file
- symbolic links have their own inode, it ca do things that hard links cannot. Like link directories, link across file system boundaries. Its similar to a shortcut on Windows
- symlink(oldname, newname) - it lies behind "ln -s" system command

- Hard Link vs Symbolic link
       Hard Link         |      Symbolic Link
  Name -> inode number   |  Name -> Another name

# Interacting with Directories
- Directories are file, they have their own inode, but can`t be opened and readed with the traditional open and read system calls.
- Every process has a current cirectory
- getcwd(buf, size) - get te current directory. buf is result, size is the size of this buf. It return a pointer to to buf, so can be embedded to another function call
- There is a symbolic constant calls PATH_MAX, this define de max size of a path name and should be a good size for buf
- chdir(pathname) - change process directory
- mkdir(name, mode) - Its similiar to creat, however, this will only create ONE directory. ex mkdir("a/b/c", 0755) will fail unless "a" and "b" already exist
- rmdir(name) - remove dir, fails unless directory is empty
- opendir(dirname) - return a handler on the directory that can be passed to readdir(handler)
- Each call to readdir(handler) will return info from one file, usually loops through until the end of the directory
- readdir(handler) return a "struct dirent", different linux distributions have different contents, but key info are the following:
-- d_ino -> inode number
-- d_type -> file type
-- d_name -> file name
- closedir(handler) - closes directory opened with opendir(dirname)

# Monitoring File System Events
- Linux kernel can send notifications if a file has been moved/created/closed/accessed/modified/deleted
- Individual files or whole directories can be watched
- System is not recursively, watch a directory, do not automatically watch sub directories
- There are Three basic steps
-- Create inotify instace (file descriptor) -> inotify_init()
-- Add watch item -> inotify_add_watch(fd, path, mask)
-- Read and process events

- mask -> Bit mask specifuing the events to be monitored
- Mask constants:
-- IN_ACCESS -> File was accessed
-- IN_ATTRIB -> File attributes changes (ownership, permissions, etc)
-- IN_CREAT -> File created inside watched directory
-- IN_DELETE -> File deleted inside watched directory
-- IN_DELETE_SELF -> Watched file deleted
-- IN_MODIFY -> File was modified
-- IN_MOVE_SELF -> File was moved
** It's nowhere close to a complete list of possible events

# Reading events
- read(fd, buf, size) - The read will block util a watched event occurs
- May get more than one event returned in a single read
- buf will return struct inotify_event with the following attributes:
-- wd, mask, cookie, len, name
