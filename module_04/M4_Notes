# The Command Line, the Environment and Time
- Accessing the command Line
- Processing command options
- The environment
- Time -> Representations, conversions, Time zones and locale
- Processing time

# Command Line Arguments
- int main(char *argv[], argc)
-- argv points to an array of pointers to strings, 
-- this array has a NULL at end
-- argv type is a poiter to pointer to char "char **argv"
-- argc tells how many arguments are, it includes the programa name as index ZERO of argv

- getopt(argc, argv, optstring) -> helps handle arguments
-- it re-order argv, putting all the optionals first
-- optstring specifies the allowed option letters
-- opstring can be used like "abn:t:" -> means "a" and "b" are boolean options, "n" and "t" are options that takes a follow argument
-- this function return the option letter or EOF

# The environment
- its just a list of strings carried by each process
- each string is a Environment variable, and usually is in UPPER case
- inside a program, we access environment using a external variable named "environ"
- "environ" point to an array of pointers, each defining an environment variable ended with '\0', and the end of the array is marked with a NULL
- "getenv(name)" can be used to obtain the value of a env viarble, or NULL if its not found
- the environment is normally passed down from a process to its children
- a process can choose to not pass on its environment

# Time
- time(NULL) -> Return the number of seconds since "the epoch" (Midnight, 1 Jan, 1970 UTC)
- from command line it can be retrieved using "date +%s" command
- in a 64bit system, time_t is a 64bit integer so it can represent time so far in the future
- however in a 32bit system, time_t will overflow in January 2038
- both "gmtime(t) and localtime(t)" receives a time_t and return te address  of a struct tm ("broken down" time)
- "gmtime(t)" -> return time in UTC
- "localtime(t)" -> return time in local time zone
- tm struct is componded by: tm_sec, tm_min, tm_hour, tm_mday, tm_mon, tm_year, tm_wday, tm_yday, tm_isdst
